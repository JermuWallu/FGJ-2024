TODO:

- Attacking:
	DONE

- Enemy:
	- make random ai


- Sound:
	- add sounds to player
	- add combat music

- Score:
	- add score and time limit
	- add end screen

- Blocking?

BUG:
- hitbox will hit owner if if its inside its collision
- Menu music starts over after selecting an option
- hitbox code very unoptimised, runs infinetly if enemy doesn't leave its body
- scores are given for the full duration of hitboxes monitoring if take_damage() is not correctly set-up

Attack Sequence:
	- player presses attack button
	- animation
	- enable hitbox monitoring & start timer
	- hitbox detects collision, calls take_damage() on hit body
	- corresboding body enables hit timer and adds score
